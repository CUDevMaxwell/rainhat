# RAINHAT

Intregrates Fedora Commons Repositories and Drupal Content Management Systems. 

This Drupal 7 module enables site administrators to define how node data is saved in 
Fedora. XML content is created by defining simple PHP snippets. File content is 
imported as is. It is hoped that this module will enable the use of Drupal as the frontend
for a Fedora Information Repository seemlessly and easily. 

Status: Early Beta. Use at your own risk, not yet ready for production environments.
